xpdf_for_OpenWRT_and_Freifunk
=============================

xpdf without X. This port ist only for "pdftotext" and some small tools.
I port it only for converting pdf to text for indexing with swish-e.


Get it with:
git clone https://github.com/smilebef/xpdf_for_OpenWRT_and_Freifunk.git


Copy this files to the OpenWRT Source-Code in a directory:
package/utils/xpdf/
and compile it.

Before compiling you must make menuconfig and make defconfig.
